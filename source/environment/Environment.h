     * state, so this is safe to call repeatedly across room transitions
     * without leaking display lists or texture slots. On any failure the
     * partially loaded state is cleaned up again before returning.
     *
     * @param entry   Pointer to the database entry describing this environment
     *                (name, texture metadata/count, binary file name). Must be
     *                non-null and have textureCount <= MAX_ENVIRONMENT_TEXTURES,
     *                otherwise this fails immediately.
     * @param bitmaps Array of raw bitmap pointers, one per texture slot, to be
     *                uploaded to VRAM. Max size of MAX_ENVIRONMENT_TEXTURES.
     *                May be null, or contain null entries, in which case the
     *                corresponding texture slot(s) are skipped.
     * @return true if the binary file was opened, validated, and fully loaded
     *         (display lists and textures); false if @p entry was invalid, the
     *         file could not be opened or failed magic/size validation, or an
     *         allocation failed while reading display list data.
     *
     * @note entry->binaryFile is a build-time string baked in by
     *       obj2environment.py. It cannot know the runtime fat/SD mount root, so
     *       it must be combined with fatBasePath before fopen() can find it.
     *       ASSUMPTION: binaryFile already contains the full
     *       "environments/<name>/" relative path. If the printed path below is
     *       missing that folder, binaryFile is actually the bare filename and this
     *       needs to be fatBasePath + "environments/" + entry->name + "/" +
     *       entry->binaryFile instead. Check environmentDb.cpp's entry to
     *       confirm behaviour.
