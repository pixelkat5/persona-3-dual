/**
 * @brief Participant of battle
 *
 * can be an enemy, partyMember or player.
 *
 * @details
 * Parent of PartyMember.cpp (which is the Player's parent) and Enemy.cpp
 * since a lot of things are shared between them, and even for some things
 * where you might not expect it like enemies have values for Armour
 * with an actuall usecase. Otherwise the goal is to really on virtual
 * functions to generalize the code as much as possible to make it
 * scalable.
