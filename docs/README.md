## Running the Game

The game requires FAT filesystem support to load assets at runtime. Currently, we only support:

- **[melonDS](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/downloads.php)** (multiplatform emulator)
- **Real DS / DSi / 3DS hardware** via [TWiLight Menu++](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/twilightmenu/)

> Other flashcard launchers may work, but are untested

### melonDS (Emulator)

1. Download `persona-3-dual.nds` and `sdcard.img.gz` from the latest release, & decompress `sdcard.img.gz` **Developers**: Build the project with `make` - this produces both `persona-3-dual.nds` and `sdcard.img`.
2. In melonDS, go to **Settings → DLDI** and enable DLDI.
3. Set the SD card image path to the generated `sdcard.img`.
> **Do NOT enable "Sync SD card to folder"**. This will wipe the contents of the folder!

Now, you can open melonDS and load the `persona-3-dual.nds` ROM!

### Real Hardware (DS / DSi / 3DS)
Requires [TWiLight Menu++](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/twilightmenu/) with DLDI patching enabled.

1. Download `persona-3-dual.nds` and `data.zip` from the latest release, & decompress `data.zip`
**Developers**: Build the project with `make` - this produces the `persona-3-dual.nds` and the content in `/data`.
2. In TWiLight Menu++ settings, ensure **DLDI access** is set to **ARM9** & the **Game Loader** is set to **nds-bootstrap**
3. On your SD card, navigate to your `/roms/nds/` folder (or equivalent).
4. Copy `persona-3-dual.nds` and the entire `/data` folder into that directory:
   ```
   /roms/nds/
   ├── persona-3-dual.nds
   └── data/
       ├── music/
       ├── video/
       └── ...
   ```
5. Launch the game through TWiLight Menu++ as normal.
